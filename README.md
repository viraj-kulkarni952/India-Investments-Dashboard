# India Investments Tableau Dashboard
This dashboard consists of a list of companies investing into India. Includes the category, state, company, company's country.

I have gathered the data based on news articles I have encountered since the start of 2020 to 2021.

The Dashboard was produced using Tableau. The Kaggle link to the dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/virajkulkarni952/investments-into-india). The link to the published dashboard on Tableau Public can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/viraj.kulkarni/viz/I3-InvestmentsIntoIndia_Dashboard/I3-InvestmentsintoIndia).
